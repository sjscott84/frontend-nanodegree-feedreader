# Feed Reader Project

This Udacity project was to build a test suite using Jasmine.js for a provided feed reader application.

## Added Features

I have added a test for a future function that would allow a user to add new feeds to the allFeeds array.  This would be done via a addNewFeed function, that would take an input of a name and url, create a new object with these details and then push to the allFeeds array.  The test ensures that allFeeds array does actually increase after the function has run and that a name and url have been entered.

## To Run Application Locally

Clone this github project locally, open index.html and project will run.
